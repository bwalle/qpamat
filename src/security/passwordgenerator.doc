/**
 * @class PasswordGenerator
 *
 * @brief Interface to generate random passwords.
 *
 * Any implementation of this interface generates passwords (normally random
 * passwords).  The important function is the method getPassword(). It takes
 * the \p length of the password it should generate and an optional parameter
 * \p allowedChars that describes the allowed characters.  
 *
 * It is a string which contains all allowed characters literally. There are four exceptions:
 *
 *   - \c A-Z is replaced with \c ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXZY.
 *   - \c a-z is replaced with \c abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxzy.
 *   - \c 0-9 is replaced with \c 0123456789.
 *   - QString::null indicates that all characters are allowed (a empty string is not permitted)
 *
 * It was a deliberate decision to use not regular expressions because not
 * every user is a programmer and lots of characters need to be escaped in
 * RegExps. I didn't want to confuse the users, even programmers get confued
 * by RegExps sometimes. <tt>:-)</tt>.
