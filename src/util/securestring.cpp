 *
 * \brief String implementation which takes care that the memory is not swapped out
 *
 * This string class takes care that the data is not swapped out to disk but kept in memory.
 * How that is done depends on the operating system. Currently, only mlock() is supported
 * on Unix platforms.
 *
 * This class is Unicode-aware because it uses UTF-8 internally to store the data. If you use
 * QString or a UTF-8 C-String, you can use Unicode. If you use a local 8-bit encoding like
 * ISO-8859-1, you need to convert the data to UTF-8 first manually.
